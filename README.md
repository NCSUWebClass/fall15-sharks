# Citizen Science Project for CSC 342

## Description:

NC State University's Paleontology Research Lab and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences are working hard to get kids involved in scientific research. Middle school students are finding fossil shark teeth and measuring them to better understand the size of sharks that lived in NC around 10 million years ago. However, only local schools can participate. You will design and prototype an online tool for this citizen science, where anyone can perform a virtual fossil dig for shark teeth, then identify and measure the teeth in their collection.
